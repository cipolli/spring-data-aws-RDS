Although this video is long, we cover quite use interesting aspects about spring boot and you can take everything you learn from this video and go off to build real applications. Bear in mind that only use this code as boiler plate or template as not every application will be the same, but the concepts of building it aren’t that much different.

This video tutorial also demonstrates the power of implementing to an interface and loose couple system.

So, this video is split in the following order
