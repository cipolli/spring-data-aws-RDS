In this tutorial, I teach you how to use spring boot connecting to a real database with spring profiles using the cloud, more specifically AMAZON WEB SERVICES.

Although this video is long, we cover quite use interesting aspects about spring boot and you can take everything you learn from this video and go off to build real applications. Bear in mind that only use this code as boiler plate or template as not every application will be the same, but the concepts of building it aren’t that much different.

This video tutorial also demonstrates the power of implementing to an interface and loose couple system.

So, this video is split in the following order

1 – Overview
2 – Spin up RDS (Amazon Relational Databases) instance.
3 – Testing the connection using database client (SEQUEL PRO)
3 – Download previous source code from git
4 - Add and configure HikaryCP Datasource using property files
5 –  Implement DAO interface, Learn SQL (CRUD) with JDBC Template
6 – Test application using postman (Rest Client)
7 – Spring profiles overview
8 – Spin up second RDS (Amazon Relational Databases) instance to act as the production database
9 – Configure Spring profiles and adding two run configurations
10 – Test changes
11 – Execute jar files with both profiles and see it in action
12 – Shut down RDS instanaces to save our free 750 hours of usage.
